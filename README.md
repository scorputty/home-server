# Home-Server project

This is my personal Home Server project. 

# Notes
I'm still learning Docker and use these private (pet)projects to develop my skills.
While I use these containers myself they are by no means perfect and are always prone to error or change.
That said, even if only one person copies a snippet of code or learns something from my projects I feel I've contributed a little bit to the Open-source cause...
